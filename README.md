# Travel_Companion
This application has pre loaded data in it that contains the total distance between any two different places and the fare that will be incurred through an auto rickshaw. The user can check the price between two locations, compare them and can directly book an auto in a faster way..   The driver can also check the fare in the application and if he is satisfied with the amount given in it, he can go forward with the booking or else can reject it. 
Complete details of the driver(name, contact number, auto registration number) will be stored in the application when they get registered through this application. Every driver is given a unique ID to be identified easily. 

So whenever a person wants to reach a public station, he/she do not need to wait for a cab or they don't even need to bargain with the auto driver. They can directly open this application and enter the Pick-up and Drop location. On submitting they get to see the total distance between those two places and the total fare. 
If they think the total fare is satisfactory, they can go to the nearest auto rickshaw and show the applet to the driver. If the driver is ready for the trip, the user needs to enter the unique ID of the driver in the application, so that he/she gets the complete details of the driver.   
Once the unique ID is entered the trip gets started.

 For example, if there are 4 major stops in between source and destination, the user in the auto gets notified at each at every stop (You reached Point-A, you are just 3 stops away from your destination) .

 This is beneficiary for both the user and the driver.
(As user do not need to wait for any cabs)
(Instead of being idle without any bookings, the driver also gets money that is accceptable)
